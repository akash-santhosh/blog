Started Computers because of a Windows XP computer from my kindergarten days. Rest is history, _although recorded history is from my_ **4th Standard of School** _when I started acessing Internet_.

 Refer this old blog of mine to know what I did then.[\[Link\]](https://medium.com/@akash.santhosh/sorrow-f62589a8fb2e)
